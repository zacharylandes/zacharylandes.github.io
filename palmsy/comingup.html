                  <p>          Janiva Magness is one of the premier blues and R&B singers in the world today. Her voice
                    possesses an earthy, raw honesty born from her life experience,
                    including growing up in the foster care system of Detroit.
                    Her talent as a singer and songwriter have earned her numerous awards and
                    accolades, including Contemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year five times
                    (2006, 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2015), Song of the Year for “I Won’t Cry” from
                    her recording Stronger For It (2013), as well as the coveted 2009 Blues Music
                     Award for B.B. King Entertainer of the Year (making he only the second woman to ever
                      win this award, Koko Taylor being the first).
                          Janiva’s 2016 album "Love Wins Again" is nominated for a Grammy in the
                          category of Best Contemporary Blues Album. "Love Wins Again" is another
                           evolutionary step for the soulfu, elegant, award-winning singer-songwriter.
                            Its 11 core songs and two bonus tracks are built on a sonically
                            sophisticated architecture that’s in full service of Magness’ remarkably
                             flexible and generous voice—which can flow smoothly as champagne or
                              churn up gravel on command. The album’s title is a mantra
                   that resonates throughout: the concept of love as a physical, psychic and spiritual force that has the
                    strength to conquer negativity, sadness and personal demons. Magness is currently up for Contemporary
                    Blues Female Artist of the Year in the Blues Music Awards.</p>

                  <p>Tonight, Magness will be joined by Zach Zunis (guitar), Garrett Deloian (guitar), Gary "Scruff" Davenport
                  (bass), and Matt Tecu (drums). </p>
