                <div class="excerpt"  >
                      <p>       Up-and-coming country singer Jaime Wyatt is a striking figure with an old soul
                        and a voice like a force of nature. Regardless of genre, the Los Angeles-based
                        Wyatt is a dynamic performer with a smoky voice, who sails naturally between vintage
                        '60s and '70s country/rock 'n' soul anthems and heartfelt country ballads of love
                        and corruption. In January, Rolling Stone included her in its list of "10 New Country Artists You Need to Know," and Country radio station 95.3 The Bear recently named her, alongside Sturgill Simpson and Margo Price, "one of the country artists
                         you may not have heard of, but need to hear."
The young singer's newest release "Felony Blues," whose title is a nod to records like David Allan Coe's "Penitentiary Blues," is a largely autobiographical collection of convict love stories, prison songs, and honky-tonk laments. After getting a record deal when she was 17, Wyatt developed an addiction, robbed her dealer, and spent eight months in county jail. She kept writing, though, and her new album is the product of her hard work and experience. Rolling Stone says, "Felony Blues offers a fresh, thoughtful take on prison songs from someone who knows firsthand about being on the wrong side of the law."</p>

                        <p> Pat Hull is a singer and songwriter from Connecticut; he is currently based out of Chico, CA, where he is on the faculty at CSU Chico. His music intertwines melodic vocals and finger-picked guitar to create a dreamy landscape with its unpredictable hooks and interesting turns.
Hull has built a devoted following in Northern California and a burgeoning reputation nationwide as both an excellent songwriter and remarkable vocalist. The Nerdist podcast recently proclaimed that Pat "has the greatest voice that you probably haven't heard" and "His gentle folk missives feel like a time capsule to a lost era, or one that has yet to happen."
Hull will be accompanied on stage by Michael Bone (bass/vocals), Sean Raeside (percussion), and Evin Wolverton (guitar/vocals).
His latest album, "Marrow," will be released on July 26, 2017.

                            <p> Chris Thomas King became the last major folk blues discovery of the 20th Century when he was "discovered" in 1985 by a folklorist from the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. He was introduced to the world the following year by venerable folk label Arhoolie Records as an authentic folk blues successor to Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters, Mississippi John Hurt and Manse Lipscomb. King has recorded numerous albums and toured internationally for over 35 years. The acclaimed artist also maintains a residency at
                              Blues Alley, the premiere Jazz club in Washington D.C.

                            King is also an actor. He was chosen by the Coen brothers to play the role of itinerant
                             bluesman Tommy Johnson alongside George Clooney in the movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
                              (2000). King also appeared in the 2004 biopic "Ray," featuring Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles,
                               and in the HBO series "Treme".

                              One of the greatest blues guitarists of his generation according to Guitarist Magazine,
                              Chris Thomas King has a sound all his own. His new EP "Les Bleus Made In Louisiana" (2016)
                               expresses the spirit of his New Orleans musical roots. Live, the Chris Thomas King trio consists of veteran drummer Jeff Mills, and Danny Infante on bass. </p>

                      Anthony Gomes has been creating virtuosic, burning blues since his recorded debut in 1998. 12 releases and numerous awards and ecstatic accolades later, Gomes shows no signs of slowing down, with his latest musical offering being his most successful to date. The aptly-named, riff-laden "Electric Field Holler" has received highly acclaimed recognition, reaching #1 on both Roots Music Report's Blues Rock Chart and ReverbNation's Global Blues Chart as well as earning several nominations for Blues Rock Album of the Year.

                        The Toronto-born singer/songwriter/guitarist is propelling blues rock into the contemporary music culture with his unapologetic approach to reinventing the genre in relevant and fresh ways. "The blues is old, but not tired" says Gomes, adding: "It speaks as truthfully today, and for this generation, as it ever has." Blues Music Magazine writes, "the formidable guitar chops and authentic singing place him in the forefront of modern blues." This, along with his high-energy shows and dynamic stage presence, make him one of the top draws on the Rock/Blues circuit today. And the facts speak for themselves: Gomes has performed in 17 countries and has shared the stage with B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Robert Plant, Joe Bonamassa, Heart, Jonny Lang, Sammy Hagar, 38 Special, Robert Cray and Kenny Wayne Shepherd.

                          Believing that music can inspire the human spirit,
                            Anthony founded the Music Is the Medicine Foundation in 2010.
                            This non-profit organization is dedicated to changing the lives of others
                            through the healing power of music. Through private donations and sizable grants,
                            the foundation has funded songwriting scholarships, offered music education programs,
                              and donated musical instruments to those in need.

              California Guitar Trio
              The universe of guitar knows no boundaries for The California Guitar Trio. Since 1991, the trio's questing spirit has driven it to explore the intersections between rock, jazz, classical, and world music. Comprised of Bert Lams, Hideyo Moriya and Paul Richards, the group has established a unique, personal connection with audiences. In addition to dazzling musicianship and interplay, The California Guitar Trio's (CGT) shows are full of captivating stories and humor.

              CGT's 15 albums, streamed over 59 million times on Pandora, offer diverse snapshots of the group's mercurial muse. The trio's most recent release, "Komorebi," showcases its acoustic side, with beautiful lush originals and innovative cover arrangements of Beatles, Beach Boys and more. Other highlights include "Masterworks," an album of classical works, with expansive takes on Bach, Beethoven, Arvo PŠrt, and Schubert; "Andromeda," which combines their many influences into a visionary album of original material; and "Echoes," which re-imagines timeless material by artists such as Mike Oldfield, Penguin CafŽ Orchestra, Pink Floyd, and Queen.

              The trio's output has made a major global impact, having served as the soundtrack for Olympics coverage, and programs on CNN, CBS, NBC, and ESPN. They have fans in high places too: NASA used their music to wake the crew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour.

              25 years and 1,800+ gigs later, the CGT remains intensely committed to explore, evolve and communicate a wide-ranging musical worldview.</p>

              <p>Montreal Guitar Trio
              Described by the CBC as the "hottest" guitar ensemble in Canada, MG3 has quickly established itself as a force to be reckoned with. For over 15 years, the trio's virtuosity, rigor, creativity and impressive stage presence have been winning over audiences around the world. The trio, composed of guitarists Marc Morin, SŽbastien Dufour and Glenn LŽvesque, has given hundreds of concerts in some of the most prestigious venues across North America, Europe, New Zealand and Australia, including the BB King Blues Club in New York, the RundetŒrnet in Copenhagen, and the legendary Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.

              Throughout the years, the trio has collaborated and shared the stage with world-renowned ensembles and artists, such as the Orchestre symphonique de QuŽbec, and Jorane et Solorazaf. Winner of the 2011 Opus Award for "concert of the year" in the Jazz / World Music category, MG3 has released six albums. "Der Prinz," under the Analekta label, was launched in February 2014, during the 15th edition of the MONTRƒAL EN LUMIéRE Festival.

              CGT+MG3 features all six virtuoso guitarists from California Guitar Trio and Montreal Guitar Trio. Representing four countries (Japan, Canada, Belgium, and the U.S.), they fuse over 40 years of combined performing experience into one unique six-by-6-string Ôphenomensemble". CGT's steel stringed-guitars blend naturally with MG3's nylon-stringed guitars, as each trio's fret boards chase the others' original compositions and new arrangements of progressive rock, world, jazz and classical music.
